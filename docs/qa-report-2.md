## Validation Checks

### Check 1: k3d Cluster Is Running

**Test:** Run `k3d cluster list`

**Expected:** One row showing `myapp` with `SERVERS 1/1` and `AGENTS 2/2` (all nodes up)

**Actual Result:**
```
Pass — myapp, servers 1/1, agents 2/2f k3d cluster list
```
Pass — myapp, servers 1/1, agents 2/2
**Status:** [x] Pass [ ] Fail

**Notes:** If any nodes aren't up, what did `kubectl describe node <node-name>` reveal?

---

### Check 2: All Pods Running

**Test:** Run `kubectl get pods`

**Expected:** All pods in `Running` state with `1/1` in READY

**Actual Result:**
```
Pass — db, flask, and nginx all 1/1 Running
```

**Status:** [x] Pass [ ] Fail

**Notes:** If any pod is not Running (Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, ErrImagePull), what did `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` or `kubectl logs <pod-name>` reveal?

---

### Check 3: Credentials Are in a Secret, Not a Deployment

**Test:** Run `kubectl get deployment flask -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env}'` and `kubectl get deployment db -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env}'`, then `kubectl get secret flask-credentials` and `kubectl get secret db-credentials`

**Expected:** Both deployment env outputs are empty (no output) or show only non-credential variables; both Secrets exist

**Actual Result:**
```
Pass — both Secrets exist; neither Deployment has inline environment values
```
**Status:** [x] Pass [ ] Fail

**Notes:** If credentials are still visible in either Deployment, which one and what variable?

---

### Check 4: RollingUpdate Strategy Applied

**Test:** Run `kubectl get deployment db -o jsonpath='{.spec.strategy.type}'`

**Expected:** `RollingUpdate`

**Actual Result:**
```
Pass — db uses RollingUpdate, maxSurge: 1, maxUnavailable: 0
```

**Status:** [x] Pass [ ] Fail

**Notes:** This checks the `db` Deployment, not `flask` — kompose only generates a `Recreate` strategy for services with a volume mount, and only `db` has one.

---

### Check 5: Check Script Passes

**Test:** Run `chmod +x scripts/check-week3.sh` then `./scripts/check-week3.sh`

**Expected:** All checks pass with exit code 0

**Actual Result:**
```
Pass — 21 passed, 0 failed; HTTP health check returned 200
```
**Status:** [x] Pass [ ] Fail

**Notes:** If any checks failed, what did the script report?

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

Review the criteria below for each part of this week's deliverables. For each criterion, record whether it was met:

### Part 1: k3d Cluster Creation

[x] k3d cluster `myapp` created with 1 server and 2 agent nodes
[x] Traefik disabled at cluster creation (`--k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"`)
[x] `kubectl get nodes` shows all three nodes `Ready`

### Part 2: Docker Compose to Kubernetes Manifests

[x] `kompose convert` generated a Deployment and Service for `db`, `flask`, and `nginx`, plus a PersistentVolumeClaim and ConfigMap
[x] All `io.kompose.service` labels replaced with `app:` labels
[x] Plaintext credentials moved to `flask-secret.yaml` and `db-secret.yaml`; Deployments use `envFrom`/`secretRef`
[x] `db-deployment.yaml` strategy changed from `Recreate` to `RollingUpdate`
[x] `flask-deployment.yaml` image reference fixed to the locally built image (not the kompose placeholder) and imported into the cluster with `k3d image import`
[x] `nginx-service.yaml` changed from `ClusterIP` to `LoadBalancer`
[x] `db-deployment.yaml` liveness probe command split into separate array items

### Part 3: Deploy and Verify

[x] Secrets applied before other manifests
[x] All pods reach `Running` / `1/1` Ready
[x] Application responds at `http://localhost:8081/health`
[x] Scaling `flask` to 2 replicas demonstrates a rolling update (new pod comes up before old one terminates)

### Part 4: Ansible Update

[x] `ansible/roles/k3d-setup/tasks/main.yml` installs k3d and creates the cluster idempotently
[x] `ansible/site.yml` includes the k3d-setup play
[x] `app-stack` play commented out in `ansible/site.yml` (Kubernetes now supersedes Docker Compose)
[x] Playbook runs clean end to end
